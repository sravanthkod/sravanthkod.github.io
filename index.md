I am Sravanth Kodavanti, working as a Research Engineer at [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) under the guidance of [Dr. Srinivas Soumitri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srinivas-s-miriyala/). I work on optimizing AI models for edge device deployment, leveraging techniques like Neural Architecture Search, Quantization and Pruning to improve performance and efficiency. My focus is on both traditional and generative AI models.

I completed my bachelors in 2024 in Computer Science at [IIT Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/). During my bachelors, I did some internships at [Gika Graph](https://www.gikagraph.ai/) (July - Sept, 2024) , [Hexagon Research](https://hexagon.com/about/research-development) (Jan - Jun, 2024) and  [OnePlus Research](https://www.oneplus.in/brand) (Jan - Jun, 2023).

I maintain a list of my publications under the [Research]({{ site.url }}/research) tab. I also [blog]({{ site.url }}/archive) every now and then compiling my personal experiences. I am always open to collaborations, and please feel free to drop me a mail!

When I'm not working, I enjoy diving into movies and web series from all over the world—exploring different languages and genres keeps things exciting. Catch my reviews at [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/sravanthkod/).
Aside from that, I like playing badminton to unwind and stay active.

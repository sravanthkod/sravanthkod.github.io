<!-- I am currently a Senior Research Scientist in Google DeepMind, where I am working in the [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) team. Our team works on improving instruction following and general model quality of the Gemini models in the post-training phase. -->

I am Sravanth Kodavanti, working as a Research Engineer at [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) under the guidance of [Dr. Srinivas Soumitri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srinivas-s-miriyala/). I work on optimizing AI models for edge device deployment, leveraging techniques like Neural Architecture Search, Quantization and Pruning to improve performance and efficiency. My focus is on both traditional and generative AI models.

<!-- I finished my PhD in August 2023 at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](http://cs.umass.edu/) in the College for Information and Computer Science. I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mohit Iyyer](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/) and worked on exciting problems in long-form text generation. I used to co-organize the [Machine Learning and Friends Lunch](https://umass-mlfl.github.io/) at UMass Amherst (Fall 2019 - Spring 2022). I graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in) in 2018. I was a part of the [CSALT](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/csalt/) group and was advised by [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/), working on problems in language modeling and sentiment classification. -->

I finished my Bachelors with major in Computer Science & minor in Entrepreneruship in August 2024 at [IIT Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/). Where I am fortunate working under [Dr. P K Srijith](https://sites.google.com/site/pksrijith/home), working on continual learning of models while mitigating the problem of catastrophic forgetting.

<!-- I've spent some excellent summers in industry and academia via internships. In Summer 2022, I interned at Semantic Scholar in [AI2](https://allenai.org/), working with Kyle Lo, Arman Cohan and Pradeep Dasigi on human evaluation of long-form summarization. In Summer 2021, I interned at the Google Research India team with Partha Talukdar and Bidisha Samanta working on low-resource multilingual style transfer. In Summer 2020, I interned at the [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain) team with [Aurko Roy](https://sites.google.com/site/royaurko) working on retrieval augmented generation algorithms. In Summer 2019 I worked on model extraction attacks with the [Google AI Language](https://ai.google/research/teams/language/) team in New York under the mentorship of [Gaurav Singh Tomar](https://ai.google/research/people/GauravSinghTomar/) and [Ankur Parikh](https://ai.google/research/people/104995/) and [Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr/).
In Summer 2017, I worked on end-to-end speech recognition at [TTIC](http://ttic.edu/), a computer science research institute at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) campus, where I was lucky to have the joint advice of professors [Karen Livescu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~klivescu), [Liang Lu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~llu/) and [Kevin Gimpel](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/). Finally in Summer 2016, I contributed to [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla)'s Automation Team via [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [Quarter of Contribution](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution). -->

I've also spent some excellent time in industry during undergrad. In Summer 2024, I worked as a AI Researcher under [Dr. Manoj Aggarwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manoj-agarwal-48b12a1/) building [Gika Graph](https://www.gikagraph.ai/), where we build the Domain specific search engines for enterprises using Knowledge Graphs & RAG.
In Spring 2024, I interned  at [Hexagon Research](https://hexagon.com/about/research-development) under [Ankan Sengupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankan-sengupta-a599b910/) working on OCR Models for text identfication on various pipeline plants.
In Spring 2023, I interned at [OnePlus Research](https://www.oneplus.in/brand) under [Dr. C Shyam Anand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-c-shyam-anand-a9252039/) working on Optmizing various DL models starting from traditional to Gen AI models using techniques like Quantization, Pruning.

<!-- When I'm not working, I am generally [birding]({ site.url }}/birding), hiking, biking reading or star gazing. I like to [blog]({{ site.url }}/archive.html) and have written a few articles compiling my experiences with graduate school admissions, visa applications, biking etc. During my undergraduate days, I used to lead a club at IIT Bombay, namely [The Web and Coding Club](https://www.facebook.com/wncc.iitb/), where we help people get started with code. I also used to actively contribute to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5080995/martianwars) and to our club's [wiki](http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki), a beginner's programming guide. Finally, I [collect]({{ site.url }}/assets/rubik.jpg) Rubiks puzzles! Unfortunately, I am not good at solving them!

Some people on the internet (especially on Mozilla's IRC) know me as *martianwars*. -->

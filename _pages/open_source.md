Outlining my projects that I have done during undergrad

#### **Course Projects**

- **Optimizing B-Spline Curves for Robot Navigation**  
  Designed and implemented an optimization framework for drone navigation using **B-spline curves**, aimed at minimizing mechanical damage and enhancing path smoothness. The work involved tuning control parameters to optimize trajectory planning while ensuring obstacle avoidance and robustness in real-world conditions.  
  Project was carried out under the supervision of *[Dr. P. Rajyalakshmi](https://people.iith.ac.in/raji/)*.

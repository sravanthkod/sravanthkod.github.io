#### **Course Projects**

- **GraphIT – Compiler for a Custom Language**  
  - *Course:* Compilers (CS3423)  
  - Designed and implemented a compiler for a new language **GraphIT**, which natively supports **graph** as a built-in data type and provides specialized syntax for graph operations.  
  - Utilized **Flex** and **Bison** for lexical and syntax analysis, and **LLVM backend** for code generation and optimization.  
  - Supervised by *[Dr. Ramakrishna Upadrasta](https://people.iith.ac.in/ramakrishna/)*.  
  - **Resources:** [Report]({{ site.url }}/assets/GraphIT_Report.pdf)  


- **Website for Publication Management System**  
  - *Course:* Software Engineering (CS4443)  
  - Designed and developed a web-based system to manage conferences and research publications, enabling streamlined submission, review, and tracking processes.  
  - Implemented features for author, reviewer, and admin roles to improve usability and workflow efficiency.  
  - Supervised by *[Dr. Manish Singh](https://people.iith.ac.in/msingh/)*.  
  - **Resources:** [Report]({{ site.url }}/assets/SW_Final_Report.pdf)  


- **Optimizing B-Spline Curves for Robot Navigation**  
  - *Course:* Internet of Things (SM5033)  
  - Developed a drone navigation system using **B-spline curves** for smoother trajectories and reduced mechanical damage.  
  - Refined control parameters for optimal path planning and obstacle avoidance.  
  - Supervised by *[Dr. P. Rajyalakshmi](https://people.iith.ac.in/raji/)*.  
  - **Resources:** [Report]({{ site.url }}/assets/IoT_Report.pdf) · [Slides]({{ site.url }}/assets/IoT_Slides.pptx)
